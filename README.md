# Hi,


I am a 15 years old game, app and web developer. I started coding two years ago. Being bored by playing game all the time, One Day I thought to make games. So, I started searching about it. I started by making games with no code softwares like Construct3, GDevelop and etc. Then, I got into godot and final my passion for coding began. And from then I learned about 7 programming and still learning new skills.


## Languages I know
- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- GDScript
-
